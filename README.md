Ever had the feeling that your phone is listening to you ?
Skewy is an idea how to make eavesdropping hard - with a simple approach: masking your speech with sound. This approach is hard to bypass since you will always be aware (hear) when the masking no longer occurs.

Ever though that your phone is accessed without you noticing ?
Technologies such as Silverpush use the inaudible frequency range to exchange information with you phone (Reference: Arp et al. 2017: Privacy Threats through Ultrasonic side Channels on Mobile Devices, TU Braunschweig). Skewy tries to identify such signals and distort them to prevent unwanted information exchange.

With the real time graphs and live sensitivity adjustments, Skewy can be used to locate inaudible frequency sources. This can range from an ultrasonic beacon to electronic equipment.
